It is a relative of the North American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), although it is somewhat smaller. The body feathers of both sexes are a mixture of bronze and green iridescent color, with neither sex possessing the beard typically found in wild turkeys. Tail feathers of both sexes are bluish-grey with an eye-shaped, blue-bronze spot near the end with a bright gold tip. These spots, or ocelli (for which the ocellated turkey is named) have been likened to the patterning typically found on peafowl. This ocellated turkey was photographed near Tikal in the Petén region of Guatemala.\n","\"\"\"\n","print(chain.run({\"text\": text}))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kFSwh2Cco0lM"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPJ2IQreAfHUOh0RQxCVYtf"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
